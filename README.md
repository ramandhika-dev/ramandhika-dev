### 🖥️ My Backend Focus
As a **Backend Developer**, I focus on building robust APIs and systems that can handle large-scale traffic and data efficiently. Some of the areas I specialize in include:

- 🛠️ **Backend Frameworks**: NestJS, Express, Laravel, Go, Java
- 🗄️ **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- 🌐 **API Development**: REST, GraphQL
- 🔒 **Authentication & Security**: JWT, OAuth2, API Security best practices
- 🏗️ **Microservices & Architecture**: Building modular systems with clean code principles
- 🚀 **DevOps & Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, AWS, Heroku

Although my primary focus is backend, I have a **basic understanding of frontend** technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy integrating frontend with backend systems.
